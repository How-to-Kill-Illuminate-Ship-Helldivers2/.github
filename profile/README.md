# How to Kill Illuminate Ships in *Helldivers 2*

In *Helldivers 2*, the Illuminate faction employs advanced Warp Ships to deploy their forces, presenting a significant challenge to players. Effectively neutralizing these ships is crucial to prevent being overwhelmed by enemy reinforcements. There are two primary types of Illuminate Warp Ships: grounded and flying, each requiring distinct strategies for destruction.

## Grounded Warp Ships

These stationary vessels function similarly to Automaton Fabricators and Terminid Bug Holes, periodically releasing groups of Voteless enemies. However, they are protected by a regenerating shield that must be depleted before the ship can be destroyed.

### Steps to Destroy Grounded Warp Ships:

1. **Deplete the Shield:**  
   Use weapons with high magazine capacity and rapid-fire capabilities to continuously damage the shield. Weapons like the **LAS-16 Sickle**, **MG-43 Machine Gun**, or **M-105 Stalwart** are effective choices. It's important to note that the shield's regeneration is based on the number of hits rather than the damage dealt, making shotguns less effective due to their single-hit nature. The shield will change from blue to purple as it takes damage and will fully regenerate if not continuously attacked within approximately **10 seconds**.

2. **Destroy the Ship:**  
   Once the shield is down, throw an explosive grenade into the open bay doors to detonate the Warp Ship. It's advisable to use grenades with immediate detonation, such as the **G-16 Impact Grenades**, to prevent them from bouncing back out. Alternatively, explosive or anti-tank weapons like the **AC-8 Autocannon** and the **CB-9 Exploding Crossbow** can be used to destroy the ship once the shield is depleted.

3. **Utilize Offensive Stratagems:**  
   For a more immediate approach, offensive stratagems like the **Orbital Railcannon Strike** can destroy a grounded Warp Ship even if its shield is active. However, many **Eagle Strikes** only deal enough damage to deplete the shields, so choose your stratagems wisely.

## Flying Warp Ships

These ships function similarly to Automaton Dropships, deploying enemy reinforcements before flying away. They lack regenerative shields but are heavily armored and nearly immune to damage from the sides. Their only weak spot is the circular bay door they open to deploy enemies.

### Strategies to Destroy Flying Warp Ships:

1. **Target the Weak Spot:**  
   When the bay doors open, position yourself to fire an anti-tank round or rocket directly into the center of the ship's underside. Effective weapons for this tactic include:
   
   - **LAS-99 Quasar Cannon:** Aim at the center of the flat circular underside without waiting for the bay doors to open.
   - **GR-8 Recoilless Rifle:** Requires positioning under the Warp Ship for a guaranteed hit. Firing from the sides will only deal partial damage.
   - **FAF-14 Spear:** A single rocket can destroy a flying Warp Ship without needing to aim specifically at the belly.
   - **ML5-4X Commando:** Approximately three to four rockets are needed per Warp Ship.

2. **Activate SEAF SAM Sites:**  
   If available on your map, prioritize activating **SEAF SAM Sites**. These are excellent at automatically targeting and shooting down flying Warp Ships within range.

3. **Use Offensive Stratagems:**  
   While the **Orbital Railcannon Strike** does not track flying Warp Ships, other offensive stratagems can be effective if timed correctly.

By employing these strategies, Helldivers can effectively neutralize both grounded and flying Illuminate Warp Ships, thereby reducing enemy reinforcements and increasing the chances of mission success.
